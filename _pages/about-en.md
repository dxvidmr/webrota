Hi! I'm a PhD student at the Centre of Lope de Vega Studies (PROLOPE) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain), funded by a FI-Joan Oró fellowship (AGAUR).   

I completed an M.A. in Literary and Theatre Research in 2022, an M.A. in Digital Humanities in 2020, both at the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (Spain), and a B.A. in Theater and Performing Arts in 2019 at the Escuela Superior de Arte Dramático de Asturias (Spain).   

My interests include Spanish Golden Age Theatre and Digital Humanities, specifically digital editing and computational drama analysis such as Network Analysis.   

I am a member of the [Digital Humanities research group](http://gruposinvestigacion.unir.net/hdaunir/) at UNIR (HDAUNIR), where we develop the [Biblioteca Electrónica Textual del Teatro en Español 1868-1939](https://github.com/GHEDI/BETTE).   

Since 2021, I have been a board member of the [Humanidades Digitales Hispánicas](https://humanidadesdigitaleshispanicas.es/).
